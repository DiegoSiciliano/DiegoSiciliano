##Biker, Gamer, Gym-Goer & Aspiring IT Pro | Living and Learning Tech Every Day

Hi everyone, my name is Diego and i go to the 11th grade at a technical high school with a specialization in Computer Science. Since the beginning of my academic journey, I have developed a strong interest in technology, especially in how software and systems work behind the scenes. My education has provided me with a solid foundation in key programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, as well as essential knowledge in computer networks, databases, operating systems, and cybersecurity principles.

In addition to my studies, I enjoy exploring new technologies independently and often dedicate time to learning beyond the classroom through tutorials, online courses, and personal coding projects. I am particularly interested in understanding how software can solve real-world problems and improve everyday life.

I consider myself a motivated and responsible student, with a strong work ethic and a proactive attitude toward learning. I work well both independently and as part of a team, and I am always looking for new challenges that allow me to grow and put my skills into practice.

I am currently seeking opportunities to gain practical experience through internships, part-time jobs, or collaborative projects in the IT field. My goal is to continue developing both technical and soft skills to prepare myself for a future career in software engineering, cybersecurity, or related areas in the tech industry.
