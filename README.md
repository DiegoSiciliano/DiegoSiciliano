## Biker, Gamer, Gym-Goer & Aspiring IT Pro | Living and Learning Tech Every Day

Hi everyone, my name is Diego and i go to the 11th grade at a technical high school with a specialization in Computer Science. Since the beginning of my academic journey, I have developed a strong interest in technology, especially in how software and systems work behind the scenes. My education has provided me with a solid foundation in key programming languages such as Python, Java, and C++, as well as essential knowledge in computer networks, databases, operating systems, and cybersecurity principles.

In addition to my passion for computer science, I have several interests that help me stay active, balanced, and motivated outside of school. I'm a big football fan—I enjoy watching it, but I also love playing with friends, as I believe it’s a sport that teaches teamwork and brings people together. Another strong passion of mine is Formula 1, which I follow closely for its mix of technology, strategy, and speed.

In my free time, I also enjoy playing video games. I find them both fun and mentally stimulating, helping me develop creativity, quick thinking, and problem-solving skills. I'm a biker and often go for rides to relax and enjoy nature. Additionally, I go to the gym regularly; staying physically active is important to me as a way to stay healthy, manage stress, and strengthen personal discipline.
