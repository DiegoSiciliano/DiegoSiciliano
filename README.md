## Biker, Gamer, Gym-Goer & Aspiring IT Pro | Living and Learning Tech Every Day

Hi everyone! My name is Diego, and I'm in 11th grade at a technical high school where I study Computer Science. Since I started school, I’ve been really interested in technology, especially how software and systems work behind the scenes. My classes have taught me the basics of important programming languages like Python, Java, and C++. I’ve also learned about computer networks, databases, operating systems, and the basics of cybersecurity.

Outside of computer science, I have many hobbies that keep me active and help me stay balanced. I really enjoy football—both watching matches and playing with friends. I think it's a great way to learn teamwork and have fun. I’m also a big fan of Formula 1 because I love the mix of technology, speed, and strategy.

In my free time, I like playing video games. They’re fun and also help me improve my creativity and problem-solving skills. I enjoy biking, especially when I want to relax and spend time outdoors. I also go to the gym regularly to stay fit, reduce stress, and build good habits.
